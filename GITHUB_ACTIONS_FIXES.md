# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. CodeQL Action Deprecation
**Problem**: CodeQL Action v2 is deprecated as of January 10, 2025
**Solution**: Updated to v3

```yaml
# Before
uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2

# After
uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
```

### 2. Permission Issues
**Problem**: "Resource not accessible by integration" error
**Solution**: Added proper permissions at workflow and job level

```yaml
# Added to workflow level
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  actions: read

# Added to security-scan job level
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  actions: read
```

### 3. Updated Action Versions
**Problem**: Using outdated action versions
**Solution**: Updated all actions to latest versions

```yaml
# Updated actions:
- actions/checkout@v4 (already latest)
- actions/setup-python@v4 → v5
- actions/cache@v3 → v4
- actions/upload-artifact@v3 → v4
- actions/download-artifact@v3 → v4
- codecov/codecov-action@v3 → v4
- aquasecurity/trivy-action@master → @0.28.0 (pinned version)
```

### 4. Security Scan Conditional Upload
**Problem**: SARIF upload failing on pull requests
**Solution**: Only upload SARIF on push events

```yaml
# Before
if: always()

# After
if: always() && github.event_name == 'push'
```

## ✅ Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Future-proof**: Using latest action versions
2. **Security**: Proper permissions for security scanning
3. **Reliability**: Conditional SARIF upload prevents permission errors
4. **Compliance**: Following GitHub's deprecation guidelines

## 🚀 What This Enables

- ✅ Security scanning with Trivy
- ✅ SARIF results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- ✅ Code coverage reporting with Codecov
- ✅ Artifact management for deployments
- ✅ Matrix testing across Python versions
- ✅ Proper permission handling

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Push these changes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Enable GitHub Advanced Security** (if using private repo)
3. **Configure branch protection rules** for main/staging branches
4. **Set up required status checks** for pull requests
5. **Configure deployment environments** in GitHub repository settings

## 🔍 Monitoring

After pushing these changes, monitor:
- GitHub Actions workflow runs
- Security tab for vulnerability reports
- Code coverage reports
- Deployment status in environments

The workflow will now run without deprecation warnings and permission errors!
